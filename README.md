## What's in it?

Rest API kit comes with the following hooks:
`"useRest"`: creates a base for apis. This hook returns a trigger function and a state object. Each works as follows:

## Usage
### Immport createRestBase
Import the `createRestBase` from `rest-api-kit` like so:
```ts
import { createRestBase } from "./base";
```

### Assign it
Assign it to a variable like so:
```const api = createRestBase({ baseUrl: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" });```

### Assign it
assign it to a variable like so:
```ts
const api = createRestBase({ baseUrl: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" });
```

### Inject the endpoints
Create the endpoints at the base of your file so it gets loaded in soon as the app launches.
```ts
const injector = api.createEndpoints((builder) => ({
  getATodo: builder({
    url: "/todos/1",
    params: {
      preferCachevalue: false,
      saveToCache: true,
      successCondition: (data) => {
        if (data.completed) {
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      },
      transformResponse: (data) => {
        // always return data;
        return data;
      }
    }
  }),
  createTodo: builder({
    url: "/post",
    params: {
      method: 'POST',
      updates: ['getATodo'],
    }
  })
}));
```
### Use it.
In the components that you need it in, you can use it like so:
```ts
const [getATodo, state] = useGetATodo();
  const { data } = state;

  console.log(state, "<= state");

  useEffect(() => {
    getATodo();
  }, [])
```
