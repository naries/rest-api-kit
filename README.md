## What's in it?

Rest API kit comes with the following hooks:
`"useRest"`: creates a base for apis. This hook returns a trigger function and a state object. Each works as follows:


If you use the `saveToCache` option when using a trigger function, then we create a cache entry based entirely on the url passed in from the same trigger. Whether that cache entry is new is dependent on:
1. If there is a cache with the same url as its key already, we then check if the `preferCacheValue` is set to `true`. If it is, we supply you the value in the cache and not createa new entry
2. If there is no cache with the same url as its key already, we make the request and create a new cache entry with the url. At this point even if `preferCacheValue` is set to true, it doesn't matter because we are only just creating the cache entry.
